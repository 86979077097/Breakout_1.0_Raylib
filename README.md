# Breakout_1.0_Raylib
üïπÔ∏è Breakout Clone using Raylib A simple clone of the classic Breakout game, built with Raylib. Control the paddle using the arrow keys and break all the bricks with the ball to win!
  This is my first version of this game; I will improve it more in the future.

  I DO NOT OWN A LICENSE FOR THE GAME; I SIMPLY RECREATED IT BASED ON WHAT I OBSERVED IT DOES.
